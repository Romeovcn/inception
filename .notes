- How docker and docker-compose works
    - Docker Compose: Docker Compose simplifies the process of managing multi-container applications. 
      You define your application's services, networks, and volumes in a docker-compose.yml file. 
      This file specifies things like which Docker images to use for each service, 
      how to configure them, and how they should communicate with each other.
    - Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications in containers.
      Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable software packages that contain everything 
      needed to run an application, including code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
      Docker provides tools and a platform to manage these containers efficiently.
- Diff between docker image used with docker-compose and without
    - It simplify the use (start, stop, configuration) of multiple containers and the connexion between them. 
      You can also manage the container volumes.
- Benefit of using dockers compared to vm's
    - Docker are lighter and faster than vm's, you can connect multiple docker together and they are simplier to configure.
- Pertinence of the directory structure required for this project
